    <script>
        //alert("You did something wrong");/*An alert box is used in the website to show a warning message to the user that they have entered the wrong value other than what is required to filled in that position */
      // confirm("Do you want to continue")/*A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.
      // When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed. If the user clicks on the OK button, the window method confirm() will return true. If the user clicks on the Cancel button, then confirm() returns false and will show null.*/
    // var val= prompt("type");
    // A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page. When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value. If the user clicks the OK button, the window method prompt() will return the entered value from the text box. If the user clicks the Cancel button, the window method prompt() returns null.
    // document.write(val); 
    // **** Variables in JavaScript are containers which hold reusable data. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
    //  *****A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.

    // Before ES2015, JavaScript variables were solely declared using the var keyword followed by the name of the variable and semi-colon. Below is the syntax to create variables in JavaScript: 
    //var var_name;
    //var x;
    // the first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters may be any letter or digit or an underscore or dollar sign.
    // After ES2015 let and const method came to declare a variable. Var and let have many simalarity but when we campare on scope constrain both differ.let and const have block scope where as var have functional scope.
    // ** Scope of a variable is the part of the program from where the variable may directly be accessible. 
    // ** Backticks provide extra functionality as with the help of them we can embed variables inside them.
